# CleaningDataWithRScript
R Script for John Hopkin's online class: Getting and Cleaning Data

**This script uses DPLYR for the last part. I highly recommend you check it out if you're just getting into R**

This script works with the following data folder available here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

When extracting the zip, make sure to put the run_analysis.R script in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder
