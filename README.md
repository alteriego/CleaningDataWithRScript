# CleaningDataWithRScript
R Script for John Hopkin's online class: Getting and Cleaning Data

**This script uses DPLYR for the last part. I highly recommend you check it out if you're just getting into R**

When extracting the zip, make sure to put the run_analysis.R script in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder

I have also added annotations and separated the code inside the script by functions to make it easier to read 

For people not in the course, this script works with the following data folder available here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
